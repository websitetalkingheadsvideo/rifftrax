## Description writing guidelines

The description is the PRIMARY triggering mechanism. It must:

1. Name the tool explicitly (e.g. "Stripe", "Resend", "Supabase")
2. List 3-5 concrete task types the skill enables
3. Include common synonyms and related terms users might say
4. Use action verbs: "create", "send", "manage", "configure", "deploy"
5. Be one paragraph, no line breaks

**Good example:**
> Use this skill when working with Stripe - payments, subscriptions, refunds,
> customers, webhooks, or billing. Triggers on any Stripe-related task including
> checkout sessions, payment intents, and invoice management.

**Bad example:**
> A skill for payment processing. (Too vague, no tool name, no task types)

## Recommended skills guidelines

The `recommended_skills` field lists 2-5 companion skills from the registry that
complement this skill. Rules:

1. Only use skill names that exist in the registry (`references/skill-registry.md`)
2. Pick skills that are complementary, not duplicative
3. Prefer skills in adjacent categories (e.g. `clean-code` recommends `code-review-mastery`)
4. 2-5 entries - fewer for niche skills, more for broadly applicable ones
5. Use an empty array `[]` only for meta skills with no natural companions
