# Product Launch

A practical framework for planning, executing, and measuring product launches.
Most launches fail not because of the product but because of poor coordination,
rushed checklists, and no rollback plan. This skill covers the full launch
lifecycle: scoping a go-to-market strategy, designing a beta program, building
function-level launch checklists, planning tiered rollouts, writing internal and
external communications, coordinating cross-functional teams, and measuring
launch success. Agents can use this to draft GTM plans, run betas, sequence
rollouts, and run launch retrospectives.

## When to use this skill

Trigger this skill when the user:
- Is planning or executing a product launch or major feature release
- Needs to build a go-to-market strategy or launch plan
- Wants to design or run a beta program (closed, open, or pilot)
- Needs a launch checklist broken down by function (eng, marketing, support, legal)
- Is planning a tiered or phased rollout (dark launch, beta, GA)
- Needs to write launch communications - internal announcements, press releases,
  blog posts, or customer emails
- Wants to coordinate a cross-functional launch squad or assign RACI ownership
- Needs to define or review launch success metrics and run a launch retrospective
- Asks about launch tiers, rollout strategy, or go-to-market execution

Do NOT trigger this skill for:
- Detailed pricing model design (use the pricing-strategy skill instead)
- Feature flag implementation details or release engineering tooling (use a
  deployment or CI/CD skill)

## Key principles

1. **Launch is a process, not an event** - A launch begins weeks before the
   public announcement and ends weeks after. The announcement date is one
   milestone in a longer arc that includes internal readiness, beta feedback,
   and post-launch iteration. Plan the full timeline, not just the day-of.

2. **Tier launches by impact** - Not every launch needs a press release and
   a company all-hands. Match the launch tier to the blast radius of the change.
   A bug fix ships silently. A new pricing model gets a full GTM program. Define
   launch tiers upfront and assign different checklists to each tier.

3. **Internal launch before external** - Every external launch should be preceded
   by an internal launch. Sales, support, and success teams must be able to answer
   customer questions before the announcement goes live. "Internal GA" is a real
   milestone; treat it as one.

4. **Measure launch success** - Define success metrics before launch, not after.
   Decide in advance what a successful week one looks like: activation rate, trial
   starts, pipeline influenced, NPS, support ticket volume. Agree on a green
   threshold. Measure against it. Run a retrospective within 30 days.

5. **Have a rollback plan** - For every launch, define the criteria that would
   trigger a rollback or pause and the exact steps to execute it. Rollback plans
   are written in calm; they are executed in chaos. Write them now.

## Core concepts

**Launch tiers** classify releases by scope and customer impact. Tier 1 is a
major launch (new product, new market, major pricing change) - full GTM, press,
exec involvement. Tier 2 is a significant feature - blog post, in-app
announcement, sales enablement. Tier 3 is a minor improvement - release notes,
internal notification. Tier 4 is a patch or internal change - changelog entry
only. Assign tier at kickoff; the tier drives which checklist items are required.

**GTM components** are the building blocks of a go-to-market plan: target
segment (who is this for), positioning (why this over alternatives), pricing and
packaging, distribution channel (self-serve, sales-led, partner-led), launch
timing, and success metrics. All six must be aligned before any launch activity
begins.

**Beta program types** serve different purposes. A closed beta gives access to
a hand-picked cohort for deep feedback - high quality signal, slow velocity. An
open beta removes the gate - broader signal, noisier data. A pilot is a
time-limited full deployment with a single customer or segment - best for
enterprise products or regulated industries. Choose the type based on what
you need to learn and how fast.

**Launch metrics** fall into three buckets: awareness (reach, share of voice,
press mentions), activation (trial starts, sign-ups, demo requests, product
qualified leads), and retention (week-1 return rate, feature adoption, churn
delta in the 30 days post-launch). Track all three; optimize for the bucket
that is weakest.

## Common tasks

### Create a GTM strategy

A go-to-market strategy answers six questions. Answer them in this order:

1. **Who** - Define the target segment precisely. Not "SMBs" but "engineering
   managers at Series A-C SaaS companies with 10-50 engineers."
2. **Problem** - State the specific pain the product solves for that segment.
   Quantify it if possible ("spend 4 hours/week on X").
3. **Positioning** - Write a positioning statement:
   "For [segment], [product] is the [category] that [key benefit] unlike
   [alternative] which [limitation]."
4. **Pricing and packaging** - Which tier or plan is the entry point? What is
   the upgrade path? Is there a free trial or freemium component?
5. **Distribution** - How does the segment discover and buy? Self-serve
   (product-led), sales-assisted (sales-led), or through a partner channel?
6. **Success metrics** - What does a successful launch look like at 7, 30, and
   90 days? Name specific numbers and who owns them.

Codify all six in a one-page GTM brief before any execution begins.

### Design a beta program

**Recruitment**
- Define who qualifies: segment, use case, technical maturity, time commitment
- Aim for 15-50 participants for a closed beta (enough signal, manageable noise)
- Recruit from existing waitlist, active customers, or outbound to target accounts
- Set clear expectations: duration, feedback cadence, and what they get in return
  (early access, pricing discount, public recognition, direct product influence)

**Feedback loops**
- Weekly check-in cadence: short async survey (5-7 questions) plus optional
  30-minute call slot
- Track usage data alongside qualitative feedback - usage tells you what they do,
  interviews tell you why
- Maintain a shared tracker of reported issues, feature requests, and blockers
  with status updates visible to beta participants

**Graduation criteria**
- Define graduation gates before the beta starts, not during
- Minimum criteria: core user journey completion rate above threshold, no
  critical bugs open, support volume sustainable at scale, NPS or CSAT
  baseline established
- Graduation is a decision meeting with eng, product, and CS present - not an
  automatic date flip

### Build a launch checklist

Break the checklist by function and time horizon. See
`references/launch-checklist.md` for the full copy-paste checklist.

**Engineering** - feature flags, performance benchmarks, error monitoring,
rollback procedure, capacity plan, data migration tested

**Product** - positioning finalized, pricing approved, feature documentation
complete, beta graduation signed off, launch tier confirmed

**Marketing** - landing page live (dark or staged), blog post drafted, social
copy approved, email sequence queued, press brief sent (if Tier 1)

**Sales** - pitch deck updated, objection handling doc written, demo environment
current, sales training completed, CRM fields updated for tracking

**Customer Success / Support** - help center articles published, support scripts
written, escalation path defined, internal FAQ distributed, surge plan in place

**Legal / Compliance** - Terms of Service updated (if needed), privacy review
completed, trademark cleared, any regulated market approvals obtained

---

### Plan a tiered rollout

A tiered rollout reduces risk by exposing new functionality progressively.

**Stage 1 - Dark launch (internal only)**
- Feature is live in production but gated to internal users (flag or allowlist)
- Goal: validate infrastructure, monitor error rates, confirm logging is correct
- Exit criteria: zero critical errors over 48 hours of internal use

**Stage 2 - Closed beta (1-5% of users or hand-picked cohort)**
- Enable for a small, willing cohort that opted in
- Goal: gather qualitative feedback, surface UX friction, confirm core value
- Exit criteria: beta graduation threshold met

**Stage 3 - Limited GA (10-25% traffic or specific segment)**
- Ramp up via feature flag or regional rollout
- Goal: validate at scale, monitor support volume, watch activation metrics
- Exit criteria: activation rate at or above target, support ticket rate below cap

**Stage 4 - General availability (100%)**
- Full launch with marketing activation
- Monitor closely for 72 hours post-launch; have on-call coverage
- Rollback trigger: error rate spike above baseline, P0 bug, or activation rate
  below 50% of target after 48 hours

### Write launch communications

**Internal announcement (pre-launch, T-5 days)**
Structure: what is launching, who it is for, how it works (one paragraph), what
changed from the previous version, key dates, and where to get help. Distribute
to all-hands Slack, sales channel, and support channel simultaneously.

**External blog post (launch day)**
Structure: problem being solved (lead with customer pain), solution overview
(show don't tell - screenshot or short video), customer quote or beta user story,
availability and pricing, call to action. Keep under 800 words. Publish at 9am
in the target market's timezone.

**Customer email (launch day or T+1)**
Subject line: lead with the benefit, not the feature name ("Save 3 hours a week
on X" beats "Introducing Y"). Body: one paragraph on the problem, two sentences
on the solution, one CTA button. No attachments. Mobile-optimized.

**Press release (Tier 1 only)**
Format: headline, dateline, lead paragraph (who/what/when/where/why), product
details paragraph, customer or partner quote, boilerplate, contact info. Send
to press contacts under embargo 48 hours before publication.

### Coordinate cross-functional launch

Use a RACI to eliminate ambiguity on every launch deliverable.

| Deliverable | R (Does) | A (Owns) | C (Consulted) | I (Informed) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GTM brief | Product | Product | Marketing, Sales | Exec |
| Landing page | Marketing | Marketing | Product, Design | All |
| Blog post | Marketing | Marketing | Product | All |
| Sales enablement | Sales | Sales | Product, Marketing | CS |
| Help center articles | CS/Support | CS | Product | Support |
| Feature flags / rollout | Eng | Eng Lead | Product | All |
| Press outreach | Marketing | Marketing | Exec | Legal |
| Launch metrics dashboard | Data/Eng | Product | Analytics | All |

Run a launch readiness review 48 hours before go-live. All R and A owners
confirm their deliverables are complete. Any open blocker halts the launch.

### Measure launch success

**Pre-launch: define the scorecard**

Before launch, fill in this template and get stakeholder agreement:

| Metric | Target (Day 7) | Target (Day 30) | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trial starts / sign-ups | X | X | Marketing |
| Activation rate (core action) | X% | X% | Product |
| Week-1 retention | X% | - | Product |
| NPS / CSAT | X | X | CS |
| Support ticket volume | < X/day | - | Support |
| Pipeline influenced | $X | $X | Sales |

**Post-launch retrospective (Day 30)**
1. What did we target vs achieve on each metric?
2. What went well in the launch process?
3. What friction did the cross-functional team experience?
4. What would we change in the checklist or process for next time?
5. Are there follow-up product changes driven by launch feedback?

Document the retro output and add lessons to the team's launch playbook.

## Anti-patterns / common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it fails | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Setting the launch date before the product is ready | Creates pressure to ship incomplete work; leads to support surges and negative first impressions | Set dates from graduation criteria upward, not from a calendar downward |
| Skipping internal launch | Sales and support get blindsided; customers hear conflicting information | Ship internally at T-5; hold a readiness call with every customer-facing team |
| Launching without a rollback plan | When something breaks post-launch, teams scramble without clear ownership or steps | Write rollback criteria and procedure before the launch; test it in staging |
| Measuring only top-of-funnel metrics | Awareness numbers look good while activation and retention quietly fail | Define and track all three buckets: awareness, activation, retention |
| Big-bang rollout for a risky change | A bug at 100% exposure reaches all users simultaneously | Always ramp via feature flags or staged rollout; reserve 100% for confirmed stable state |
| Treating every release as a Tier 1 launch | Team exhaustion; diminishing attention; cry-wolf effect with press and customers | Define launch tiers at kickoff; reserve full GTM effort for true Tier 1 releases |

## References

For a detailed, ready-to-use checklist broken down by function and launch phase,
load the reference file:

- `references/launch-checklist.md` - comprehensive launch checklist organized
  by function (Engineering, Product, Marketing, Sales, CS/Support, Legal) and
  time horizon (T-30 through T+30), suitable for copy-paste into any project
  management tool

Only load the reference file when actively building or running a launch - it is
long and will consume context.
